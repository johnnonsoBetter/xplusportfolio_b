## Why Xplusportfolio
Trying to get into the tech industry without professional experience is hard, so expert in the software industry suggest one way to show potential employee that you have the ability to perform the job is to have a portfolio with solid projects, 
But it's even harder to build something that is worthwhile due to maybe lack of motivation, New ideas and required skills.

### How does xplusportfolio address these problem

#### Lack of motivation
Anticipate: A User can use the platform to share a project they are working on then set a deadline to complete the project, other users are able to subscribe to the user’s anticipation and wait till the project has been launched to improve it.
This helps the user put in the work and complete the project because he is aware that other users are waiting for his project.

### New Ideas
Gain New Ideas: Users are able to suggest new ideas for an existing project to be worked on, helping the user to add more advanced features and fix bugs. “Imagine turning a todo-app into a todoist by suggesting useful features like login, push notifications and more“.  The reality is that no app is stupid and a toy, it requires better features to make it more useable.

### Required Skills
Share Resource: What use would it be to suggest a complex feature for a project and not give the user direction to accomplish it. Users not only share suggestions to be worked on, they can share resources to accomplish the suggestion.
